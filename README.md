# Project1
# Example of the work I've produced in my Statistics courses in the Applied Digital Sociology program
# My research question was examining if respondents demographics influence their social prestige
# For this analysis, my dependent variable was socioeconomic index score and my independent variables were age, gender, and place of birth
# Overall, demographics are influential to respondents' social prestige. However, a person being  native or foreign born does not affect their prestige.
